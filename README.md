- 👋 Hi, I’m @JacobParent7
- 👀 I’m interested in designing and programming software and hardware. While circuit synthesis and design is my focus in college, programming is my minor and also a hobby which I like to do in my free time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning System Verilog, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Android Development w/Kotlin and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever projects pertain to my interests.
